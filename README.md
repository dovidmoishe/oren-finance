# Oren

**Your intelligent investing agent for tokenized stocks on Solana.**

Oren makes it easier to explore, buy, and manage tokenized stocks. You see familiar companies and tickers; Oren handles the token variants, market data, and trading routes behind the scenes.

Connect a Solana wallet to see your portfolio, research a stock, chat with the Oren agent, and review a trade before signing it yourself.

> You think in stocks. Oren handles the onchain complexity.

## What you can do with Oren

- **Explore stocks:** Browse and search supported tokenized equities, then dig into prices, charts, news, and market activity.
- **Understand your portfolio:** See supported holdings, USDC cash, performance snapshots, activity, and a trading calendar in one place.
- **Ask Oren:** Get portfolio-aware answers and stock research backed by market data and calculated signals. The agent can suggest trades and baskets for you to review.
- **Trade with your wallet:** Buy or sell through Jupiter, or set a limit order. Oren prepares the transaction; you review and sign it.
- **Discover traders:** Browse the leaderboard and public profiles, and prepare a copy-portfolio proposal.
- **Plan a longer hold:** View the Oren Vault experience for time-locking stock tokens. Vault transactions are currently disabled until the onchain program is deployed and verified.

The experience is built around a simple flow:

Discover → Research → Review → Sign → Track
```

Oren's intelligence scores and technical indicators are calculated in code. The AI agent explains those results and helps turn ideas into actions, but it never signs a transaction for you.

## How it fits together

Oren uses a **Next.js app** for the website and trading interface, a **NestJS API** for portfolio, market, agent, and execution features, and a **Solana program** for the Vault. Tokens supplies stock and market data; Alchemy reads wallet state; Jupiter provides trading routes. PostgreSQL remembers things like portfolio snapshots, conversations, and executions. Solana remains the source of truth for assets and transactions.

## Run it locally

You'll need Node.js 22, pnpm 11.22.0, PostgreSQL, and Tokens and Alchemy API keys. A Solana wallet is needed to try wallet flows; an OpenAI API key enables the agent.

1. Copy [`api/.env.example`](api/.env.example) to `api/.env`. Set `POSTGRES_URL`, `TOKENS_API_KEY`, `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, and `PORT=3001`.
2. Start the API:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location api
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:sync-stocks
   pnpm start:dev
   ```

3. In another terminal, start the app:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location app
   'NEXT_PUBLIC_OREN_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api' | Set-Content .env.local
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm dev
   ```

Open `http://localhost:3000` for the landing page or `http://localhost:3000/app` for the product. The API runs at `http://localhost:3001/api` with this setup. Keep credentials in local environment files, outside Git.

## Project status

The app includes markets, portfolios, agent chat, trading, baskets, limit orders, social profiles, a calendar, and the Vault interface. Some connected-wallet and production flows still need live verification. Vault transactions are gated by `VAULT_PROGRAM_LIVE=false` until the program is deployed on mainnet,
